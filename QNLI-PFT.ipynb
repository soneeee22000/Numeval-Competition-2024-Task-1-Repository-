My teammates can use this code for their tasks as well and learn from it. )\n",

        "Here are the key steps conceptually:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Preparation**\n",
        "   - We have the QNLI-Stress test dataset with train/dev/test splits \n",
        "   - It contains premise-hypothesis statement pairs labeled 'answers' as entailment/neutral/contradiction\n",
        "   - We use this labeled data to teach our model for inference\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Model**\n",
        "   - Load a pretrained RoBERT model \n",
        "   - Add a Classification Head (Linear layer) on top for 2-class prediction\n",
        "   - This head will predict entailment vs neutral vs contradiction given three different vector representations of the premise-hypothesis pair \n",
        "   ( original vs scientific notaion vs digitized )\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Finetune BERT + Classifier Model** \n",
        "   - Jointly finetune the RoBerta layers AND the classification head \n",
        "   - We pass the concatenated premise-hypothesis strings through Roberta to get vector representations\n",
        "   - Feed the vectors to classifier head to predict entailment or Neutral or contradiction probability \n",
        "   - Update the whole model end-to-end by comparing predictions with true labels\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Inference**\n",
        "   - For a new premise-hypothesis pair\n",
        "   - Get vector outputs from finetuned RoBERT model\n",
        "   - Pass vectors to the tuned classifier head \n",
        "   - It will predict if hypothesis is entailed or neutral or contradiction w.r.t premise quantities\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, you finetune RoBERT in conjunction with an added classifier layer in an end-to-end fashion. This tuning teaches the linguistic inference logic. The finetuned model can then be used for inference on new examples.\n"

It achieved state-of-the-art performance on a variety of natural language processing tasks. However, BERT has some limitations, such as its tendency to memorize text rather than truly understanding its meaning.\n",

These changes have led to improved performance on a variety of tasks, including QNLI.\n",

        "Freeze the RoBERTa model weights ? why because ...\n",
        "\n",
        "The reason for this is that the pre-trained RoBERTa model has already learned powerful language representations. These representations are likely to be useful for our task, so we want to keep them intact. By freezing the pre-trained weights, we prevent them from being modified during training. This allows us to fine-tune the model without forgetting what it has already learned.\n",
        "\n",
        "you want more?\n",
        "\n",
        "When you freeze the weights of the pre-trained RoBERTa model, you're essentially preventing the model from learning anything new. The pre-trained weights represent the knowledge that the model has acquired from its extensive training on a massive dataset of text and code. Freezing these weights ensures that this valuable knowledge remains intact and is not overwritten during the fine-tuning process.\n",
        "\n",
        "With the pre-trained weights frozen, the only part of the model that is updated is the newly added classification head. This head is responsible for taking the output of the RoBERTa model and transforming it into the desired predictions for the specific task at hand. By fine-tuning the classification head, you're essentially teaching the model how to interpret the pre-trained language representations and make specific decisions for the QNLI task.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach of fine-tuning pre-trained models is becoming increasingly popular in NLP because it allows you to leverage the vast knowledge of these models while still tailoring them to your specific task. By freezing the majority of the pre-trained model, you're ensuring that you're not disrupting the model's ability to understand and represent language, while simultaneously allowing you to adapt it to the nuances of your task.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, fine-tuning is about extending the capabilities of a pre-trained model rather than completely retraining it from scratch. You retain the benefits of the pre-trained model's knowledge while adding the ability to perform specific tasks. This approach has led to significant advances in NLP and is widely used for tasks like natural language understanding, machine translation, and text generation."
